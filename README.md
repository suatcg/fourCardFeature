## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I've done a practice to responsiveness via HTML, CSS, as well as media queries, which helped me out, see some cool effects, especially when I was using the grid and flex templates. I divided into boxes different scales via grid and centered all over the page. In addition, I've learned to adjacent corner flex-items, whereby given to auto margin two sides, it could reside to corner without any changes its size. In this case, I gave it to the image items like the below code snippet, as you can see:

```css
.mini-cell img {
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-top: auto;
  width: 5rem;
  height: 5rem;
}
```
